These are files/code that were made obsolete by new features in the API - they are not relevant to the project and only remain for educational purposes.

As you will see, files in the root of this folder are from older sections of the Udemy course: files in separate folders are newer sections. In the course, files were divided as part of the section that the code, that is found at the bottom of the file, is labelled with (the 3 hashtags above the block of code). Thus, folders in the root of this one were, at the beginning of the course, in the root of the project.
